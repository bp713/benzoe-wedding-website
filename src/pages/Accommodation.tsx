        The venue is reserved exclusively for us and our guests. There are
        enough rooms for everybody to stay at the venue the night before the
        wedding and the night of the wedding, if you would like to.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        To give you an idea of prices, the 2025 room rates are as follows (per
        room, per night):
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
        <li>6 rooms at £135 + VAT</li>
        <li>20 rooms at £215 + VAT</li>
        <li>4 junior suites at £240+ VAT</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        Please note, certain rooms will be reserved for the bridal party and
        immediate family. To make things as fair as possible, those who are
        staying at the venue for two nights will have first choice when it comes
        to room allocation.
      </p>{" "}
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        Please let us know on your RSVP whether you would like to stay at the
        venue, and we will get back to you with more information.
      </p>

        I only want to stay at the venue the night of the wedding, is that okay?
      </h2>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        Of course! There will be an option on the RSVP to let us know whether
        you'd like to stay for one or two nights, or whether you'd prefer to
        sort your own accommodation.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-6">
        What if I don't want to stay at the venue?

      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        Rise Hall is about 15-20 minutes drive from Beverley and about 20
        minutes from Hull if you would prefer to stay offsite (or, of course,
        you may just want to sleep in your own beds!) Nearby hotels include:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
        <li>Premier Inn - Beverley Town Centre Hotel (18 minute drive)</li>
        <li>Premier Inn - Hull City Centre (24 minute drive)</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-6">
        The only thing to bear in mind is that there is limited signal at the
        venue, so taxis will need to be booked in advance.
